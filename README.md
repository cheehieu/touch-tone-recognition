touch-tone-recognition
======================

Matlab algorithm to decode computer- and user-generated dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) touch tones

Developed in Spring 2010 for USC's Signal Processing (EE345) course.

Implemented an algorithm entirely in Matlab to decode computer- and user-generated dual-tone multi-frequency touch tones from audio samples using FFT, signal denoising, pitch extraction, and sound visualization. Included a GUI to manipulate and visualize data.
